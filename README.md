Iterative Parallel Test to Detect and Diagnose of Multiple Defects for Digital Microfluidic Biochip

All the txt files are examples of a biochip where 0 represents a correct electrode and 1 represents a open fault electrode. 

latest.c is the program that contains the algorithm that can detect the fault location in digital microfluidic biochip. It takes as input one of the biochip(text file) as input to detect the fault in them.
