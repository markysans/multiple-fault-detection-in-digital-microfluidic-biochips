Iterative Parallel Test to Detect and Diagnose of Multiple Defects for Digital Microfluidic Biochip

all the txt files are examples of a biochip where 0 represents a correct electrode and 1 represents a open fault electrode. latest.c is the program that contains the algorithm that can detect the fault location in digital microfluidic biochip. I uses on of the biochip(text file) as input to detect the fault in them.
